1. This directory has scripts to generate the fig3, it runs a total of 5 experiments.
2. Time estimation: 30 mins approx. 
3. Storage estimation: 5 GB approx.
4. Use ./script.sh to begin the simulations.
5. A little fluctuation in FC(Fill cycle) and PC(Probe cycle) is expected due to different random seed than the fig3 in paper pdf.
