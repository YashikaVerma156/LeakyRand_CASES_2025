# LeakyRand\_CASES\_2025
# LeakyRand: An Efficient High-fidelity Covert Channel in Fully  Associative Last-level Caches with Random Eviction
LeakyRand is evaluated on trace-based micro-architectural simulator ChampSim, full-system simulator Gem5, Intel Xeon processor and on a Spartan-3E FPGA board.

## ChampSim:
Refer to README and code in ChampSim\_code\_and\_result/ <br>
In the current version, the ChampSim code can only be executed inside a Docker container. The corresponding Docker image with all the pre-requisites is available at Zenodo link https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16237834

## Gem5:
Refer to README and code in Gem5\_code\_and\_result/ <br>
The Ubuntu disk image with pre-compiled program binaries is available on Zenodo link https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16237834

## Intel Xeon:
Refer to README and code in Intel\_Xeon\_code\_and\_result/

## FPGA board:
Refer to README and code in FPGA\_synthesis
