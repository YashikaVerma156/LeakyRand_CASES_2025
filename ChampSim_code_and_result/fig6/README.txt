1. This directory has scripts to generate the fig6, it runs a total of 500*5 experiments.
2. Time estimation: 300 hours approx. (if the simulations are run with num_prl = 1. Higher the value of num_prl, simulation time is reduced roughly by a factor of num_prl.)
4. Storage estimation: 200 GB approx.
5. Set $num_prl in script.sh.
6. Use ./script.sh to begin with the simulations.
