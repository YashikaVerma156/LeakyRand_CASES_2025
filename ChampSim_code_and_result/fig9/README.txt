1. This directory has scripts to generate fig9, and runs a total of 5*500 experiments.
2. Our result used to generate fig9(in paper) is in our_data.txt.
3. Time estimation: 417 hours approx. (if the simulations are run with $num_prl = 1. With $num_prl > 1, simulation time is reduced roughly by a factor of $num_prl.)
4. Storage estimation: 120GB
5. Use ./script.sh to begin the simulations after setting up $num_prl value in script.sh
