This directory holds scripts and results for clear cache experiments. These experiments are done to identify cache region in the beginning of the covert channel. 

The list of experiments and their respective bash scripts are as follows.
1. Repeat the whole array (which is incremented by a fraction controlled by variable inc_counter) a certain times to identify the LLC occupied : clear_cache_script.sh
2. Repeat 1x 6 times and then follow any of the below strategy
   a) Access extra fraction of array and repeat just that : clear_cache_script_mix_1x_and_a_percentage_of_array.sh
   b) Increase extra array fraction and repeat whole array till >=99% of LLC is occupied : clear_cache_script_mix_1x_and_a_percentage_of_array_repeat_whole.sh
3. Multile core script for 2.a :
   1) clear_cache_master_script_mix_1x_and_a_percentage_of_array_run_multiple_program.sh.
   2) clear_cache_slave_script_mix_1x_and_a_percentage_of_array_run_multiple_program.sh
4. Mainak sir had provided some extra experiments(to calculate the number of misses during access phase). The scripts corresponding to these experiments are:
   a) To run the experiment: Mainak_sir_clear_cache_script.sh
   b) Region identification text files are stored in the respective folders, path : /home/yashikav/Desktop/Mirage_project/ChampSim_for_mirage_forward_fill_early_with_error_correction_with_LLC_occupancy_mediator/clear_cache_in_the_beginning/clear_cache_result_files
   Names similar to: Mainak_sir_clear_cache_stats_1.8_3_1.txt
   c) To generate the result for number of misses during the access phase, do like this : python3 Mainak_sir_collect_data.py result_random_1_champsim.trace_clear_cache_1.8.gz.txt
5. Script for dynamic algorithm experiments, you will have to edit the program in pin directory and accordingly provide the array size to this script: verifying_dynamic_algo_region_identification_results.sh
   Takeout the data about the occupancy and access cycles manually from the ChampSim result file.
   ChampSim RESULTS ADDED IN THE PAPER FOR DYNAMIC ALGORITHM GENERATED SEQUENCES: /home/yashikav/Desktop/Mirage_project/ChampSim_for_mirage_forward_fill_early_with_error_correction_with_LLC_occupancy_mediator/clear_cache_in_the_beginning/dynamic_algo_result


####### Folder for results used in ISCA submission #######
Earlier results were updated because 1) the LLC latency was increased by 4 cycles to account for Mirage design, 2) Flush instruction retirement is delayed till the flush is actually done.
path: /home/yashikav/Desktop/Mirage_project/ChampSim_for_mirage_forward_fill_early_with_error_correction_with_LLC_occupancy_mediator/clear_cache_in_the_beginning/clear_cache_result_files_updated
Script used for these is: clear_cache_script.sh
