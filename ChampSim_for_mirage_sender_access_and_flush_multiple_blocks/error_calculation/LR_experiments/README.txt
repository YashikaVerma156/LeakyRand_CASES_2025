This directory includes scripts to run the experiments when the sender accesses two new blocks to send a bit 1. Scripts below are the starters for the experiments.
1. start_LR_WITH_ERR_CORR_EXP_both_algo_sender_access_and_flush_multiple_blocks.sh : This script runs experiments when sender accesses and flushes multiple blocks but receiver trigger only single iteration of error correction algorithm.
2. start_LR_WITH_ERR_CORR_EXP_both_algo_sender_access_and_flush_multiple_blocks_multiple_algo_itr.sh: This script runs experiments when sender accesses and flushes multiple blocks and receiver also trigger multiple iteration of error correction algorithm.


Updated on May 28, above scripts are old:

1. The script used for generating the LLC size sensitivity data is : start_LR_WITH_ERR_CORR_EXP_both_algo_sender_access_and_flush_multiple_blocks_multiple_algo_itr_optimized_LLC_size_sensitivity.sh
2. The script used for LR results is : start_LR_WITH_ERR_CORR_EXP_both_algo_sender_access_and_flush_multiple_blocks_multiple_algo_itr_optimized.sh
